## Hi, I’m Olamide!

Technology has the power to educate, assist, and connect people.
That belief drives my work as a web developer and AI enthusiast.

With a background in software engineering, I focus on building digital experiences that are not only innovative, but intentionally accessible and inclusive.

My journey began as a digital literacy instructor, where I saw firsthand how thoughtful technology can empower individuals and expand access to information. That experience shaped my interest in using web development and AI to support learning, usability, and equity.

I enjoy collaborating on projects that blend creativity, impact, and user-centered design — especially those that prioritize accessibility from the start.

### Current Focus
- Digital accessibility (WCAG-aligned web and document accessibility)
- Web development and UX
- AI-assisted tools that improve learning and usability

### Featured Project
- **Accessibly** — an AI-powered accessibility assistant focused on clear, practical guidance for audits, inclusive design, mobile accessibility, and document accessibility.

If you’re interested in building thoughtful, accessible technology, feel free to connect.
